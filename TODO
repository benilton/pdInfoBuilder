1) there should be a mechanism for platform-specific templates
2) man page support for template (man page will apply to all instances
of a class of chip)
3) wiring in the crlmm.regions and params components coming from
Benilton -- this is proceeding through the annotation/* svn
dropoff -- parms_store, anno_store, data_store
4) waiting for affyio:::read.celfile to read SNP6-CEL files so i can
   test the prototype for pdInfo on SNP 6. (done)
5) still need to handle the QC units on SNP6. (done, afaik)
6) waiting for parsers for Exon arrays (affxparser??)
7) add support to SNP 5.0?
