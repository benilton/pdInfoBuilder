Changes by BC in Feb-Mar 2009
** Added new builders for NGS Tiling and Affy Exon. These builders use the minimum of "gene-centric" annotation and should be able to link to org pkgs to extract more info.

03-08-09 - Benilton Carvalho
** In the new builder (v2) for Exon arrays, added a statement to remove probes that are not in the probeset.csv file.

03-09-09 - BC
** Added support to Gene ST arrays. Because these share *much* of the Exon arrays structure, I reused most of the code by adding the 'geneArray' argument to the relevant functions (parsers/builder)

03-17-09 - BC - Committed version  1.7.13
** Added support to HT Expression arrays. The same structure is expected to serve to regular Affymetrix Expression arrays as well

** Several unused functions and structures were removed.
